# neuralgae

For NaNoGenMo 2015: a set of scripts which generate a sequence of loosely-related abstract deepdream images and a randomly-generated eight-line verse for each illustration.

## Components

### deepdream.py

This is an adaptation of the Google Deepdreams ipython notebook.
I've added Audun's deepdraw technique to it
